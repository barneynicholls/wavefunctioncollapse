# wavefunctioncollapse
Exploration of Wave Function Collapse with Unity.

This is based on the excellent work from [Garnet on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g440SA2hKU) and the repository: [here](https://github.com/GarnetKane99/WaveFunctionCollapse)

I've tweaked the code a bit and it has quite a large performance boost but is still relatively easy to understand.

This version has been updated to work with a 3D environment
